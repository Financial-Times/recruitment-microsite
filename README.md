# Recruitment Microsite

**Issues that are still there to be solved**
- [ ] When loading the page - font of the nav is jumping(? - true?)
- [ ] Accordion - when open job description its size is jumping
- [ ] Make sure that vacancy description opens when you press on arrow (not only on vacancy title)
- [ ] On the smallest mobile “Creative collaboration. 24/7” needs bigger margin
- [ ] FT Product and Tech logo - link to the index page
- [ ] “Current openings” in the nav - link to current openings
- [ ] From nav to where the link goes - smooth scroll

**_AND_**
- [ ] Break css into smaller files with meaningful names
- [x] Link "openings" pug to data.json
- [ ] Think how we can add modules to pug: e.g. meta can be as a separate module
- [ ] Add META pictures
