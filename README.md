**Issues that are still there to be solved**
- [x] Accordion - when open job description its size is jumping
- [x] Make sure that vacancy description opens when you press on arrow (not only on vacancy title)
- [ ] On the smallest mobile “Creative collaboration. 24/7” needs bigger margin
- [x] FT Product and Tech logo - link to the index page
- [x] “Current openings” in the nav - link to current openings
- [ ] From nav to where the link goes - smooth scroll

**_AND_**
- [ ] Break css into smaller files with meaningful names
- [x] Link "openings" pug to data.json
- [x] Think how we can add modules to pug: e.g. meta can be as a separate module
- [ ] Add META pictures
