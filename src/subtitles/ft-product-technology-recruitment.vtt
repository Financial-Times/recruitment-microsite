00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.760
What is FT?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.780
I’ll start with the fact that
it’s not just a newspaper—

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.280
it’s much more than that.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
We are here to deliver
world-class journalism, globally,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.840
and in modern democracies

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.920
that’s phenomenally important.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.600
My perception of the FT was very different
to how it actually is:

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.760
Quite boring and serious…

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.360
Very traditional,
very corporate…

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.860
I’d have a to wear a suit and tie…

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.640
But it turns out it’s nothing like it

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.540
It’s really, really relaxed

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.040
In reality, I get to wear a denim jacket

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.080
Our manifesto is to try to
change the way we think about stories.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.860
Technology is absolutely
fundamental to the FT.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.780
We are, in essence,
a technology firm;

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.840
all our growth in the future is
going to come from

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.540
the products and services
that we build for our customers.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.660
We don’t want to give people
systems and code;

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.400
we want to
give people outcomes

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.080
and problems to solve.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.820
We do some weird stuff!
No-one’s ever told,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.100
“No you can’t do that.”

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960
For me the FT is one of the
most exciting places to work right now

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
because we get to try cool new,
sometimes slightly crazy things.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.700
Working with colleagues in Product,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.820
we made a news game.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.240
It was the first ever game
that we made that is also a piece of journalism.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.660
It tells the story of being an Uber driver.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.800
This kind of creativity is basically
empowering the whole team

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.520
to try to make our job
the best way we can.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.900
After the grad scheme,
I did a secondment for three months

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.760
where I worked in the
Operations and Reliability team.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.080
We were encouraged to do rotations
around different departments,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.760
again exposing me to new technologies and
more scope for learning.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.760
People are constantly
pushing you further

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.880
and trying to really help you
progress in terms of your skill set

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.120
but also your career
as well.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.580
We take pride in the fact that
we collaborate across geographies,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.700
across sectors,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.820
across specialisations.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.940
There’s a real sense of community here.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.980
It’s just a really warm place where people are friendly

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.740
and want to get to know you.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.160
My favourite thing at the FT is that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.580
no matter who you are,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.060
you can be who you want to be at work.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.140
There’s lots of social things going on,
on a regular basis

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.700
We have clubs around
board games, and photography;

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
you get to bond
and talk to people

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.640
on all sorts of levels
outside of work

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.540
and that enriches
you as a person, really.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280
I’m part of the FT netball team;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.120
we play every Monday night
and it’s a mix,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.520
so I’m in the Technology department
but it’s journalists as well,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.080
and people from
all parts of the company.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.220
The diversity of people that we have here
in FT is enormous:

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.960
We have a lot of people coming
from different backgrounds,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.720
that have different knowledge,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.640
they different soft
and hard skills,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.100
which is something
you can steal from them

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.960
but they’re also
eager to share with you!

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.180
They’re always eager to explain.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.740
We have lots of talks,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.680
we have inspiring
speakers coming in.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.820
We are quite good at promoting
internal speaking and sharing,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.100
and external voices
coming in as well, to inspire.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.400
I ask people to
value the fact that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.180
if they do choose to join the FT,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.500
they are supporting an organisation
which is standing up for the truth,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.540
holding power to account.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.340
That, for me, is
why I choose to work for the FT.
